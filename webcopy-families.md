## The Problem Section

**Headline**: You work hard. Your money should work harder.

**Pain Points** (Emotional, Relatable):

### The Waiting
You send money on Monday. Mom needs it for medicine. "Has it arrived yet?" Tuesday: No. Wednesday: No. Thursday: Finally. But she needed it Monday.

The guilt. The helplessness. The "I sent it, I promise."

### The Fees That Hurt
You send: £200
Western Union takes: £15
Exchange rate markup: £12
Family receives: £173 equivalent
That missing £27 could buy groceries for a week.

### The Complicated Process
Fill out forms. Agent fees. ID checks. Reference numbers. Store locations that close early. Queues on your lunch break.

Just to send money to your own mother.

### The Worry
Did it go through? Did they get it? Was the amount right? Is the money safe? Will they be able to pick it up?

Sleep lost. Calls made. Stress added to an already long day.

## Real Family Stories

**Headline**: Real people, real relief

### Story 1: Emergency Medical Care
**Nkem, Nurse in London → Mother in Enugu**

*"My mum needed surgery. The hospital wanted payment upfront. It was a Saturday evening. I sent £2,000 via Relyr at 8pm London time. By 9pm Nigerian time, the hospital confirmed receipt. Surgery happened Sunday morning.*

*Before Relyr, I would have panicked. Waited until Monday. Found a Western Union. Hoped it went through. This time, I just sent it. It worked. Mum is fine."*

### Story 2: School Fees
**Kwabena, Teacher in New York → Sister in Kumasi**

*"School fees are due on specific dates. Miss the date, your kids don't write exams. I used to send money a week early via bank wire, hoping it would arrive on time. Stressful.*

*Now I send on the day before, knowing my sister will have it same day. No more buffer. No more anxiety. Just reliable."*

### Story 3: Monthly Support
**Grace, Accountant in Dubai → Parents in Nairobi**

*"I support my parents monthly. I set up a recurring payment through Relyr. Every 1st of the month, automatically sent. They know it's coming. I don't have to remember. It just happens.*

*Plus, I calculated I'm sending them $50 more each month compared to the old method, just from better rates. That's $600 a year extra for them."*

### Story 4: Building the Family Home
**Tunde, Engineer in Canada → Building Project in Ibadan**

*"We're building a house back home. Every month, contractor needs payment. With bank wire, it was $45 per transfer plus terrible exchange rates.*

*With Relyr, I send exactly what's needed, when it's needed. The contractor gets paid fast, work doesn't stop, and I'm saving hundreds on each transfer. The house is ahead of schedule."*
