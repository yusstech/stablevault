## The Problem Section

**Headline**: Your business is global. Your banking isn't.

**Pain Points Grid**:

### Slow Supplier Payments
Order placed today. Payment "sent" via wire. Supplier confirms receipt in 5 days. Shipment delayed because they're waiting. Your customers are waiting. Opportunities lost.

### High Transaction Costs
$10,000 payment to supplier.
Wire fee: $45
Intermediary bank fee: $25
FX markup: $350
You just paid $420 to send your own money.

### Payment Collection Barriers
International customer wants to pay you.
"We can't process payments to Nigeria."
"Your country isn't in our system."
Sale lost. Not because of your product, but your location.

### Multi-Currency Chaos
USD in one account. EUR in another. NGN in a third.
Reconciliation nightmare. Conversion delays. Locked spreads.
Your accountant hates you.
