## How We Keep It Fast Section

**Headline**: Speed without sacrifice

**Technology Explanation** (simplified):
Traditional banks use old systems (SWIFT) that take days and involve multiple intermediaries. Relyr uses modern payment rails and stablecoin technology to move money directly — cutting out the middlemen and the waiting.

**The difference**:
- **Traditional Banks**: 3-5 business days, multiple fees, unclear rates
- **Relyr**: Minutes to instant, one transparent fee, real-time rates
