## The Problem Section

**Headline**: You've felt this frustration before.

**Pain Points** (grid layout):

**The Waiting Game**
Invoice sent: Day 1
Payment "processed": Day 5
Actually in your account: Day 8
You need to eat: Every day

**The PayPal Problem**
"Sorry, we don't support your country."
Or worse: "Your account has been limited."
Your money held hostage for 180 days.

**The Fee Robbery**
Client pays: $1,000
PayPal takes: $50
Bank conversion: Another $45
Wire transfer fee: $25
You actually get: $880
Your actual rate just dropped 12%.

**The Currency Trap**
Earned in dollars. Paid in dollars.
But stuck converting at terrible bank rates.
Value lost every single time.
